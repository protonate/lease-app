WEATHERIZATION AGREEMENT

Tenant(s): [TENANT NAME 1]

Tenant(s): [TENANT NAME 2] et al (and all others)
Address: [STREET ADDRESS] Unit:
City: [CITY] OREGON Zip: [ZIP CODE]

For Houses & Duplexes:

1) Cover all foundation vents: These are the holes around the perimeter of the house. They should be blocked off to stop wind and cold
from getting under the house and to the pipes. Snug-fitting cardboard works very well for this. DO NOT LEAVE COVERS ON
VENTS FOR PROLONGED PERIODS, only during the cold spell. Ventilation is necessary to prevent moisture damage to the
building and furnishings.

2) Disconnect all outside hoses, hose splitters & water features: (i.e. Hot Tubs, Fountains, etc.) All should be disconnected and drained
before winter/freezing temperatures begin. Please double check when the temperature drops below 26°. This allows proper draining
of the pipes and prevents freeze damage. It's also a good idea to purchase a cold weather faucet cover or wrap the faucet with rags/
newspaper and secure with string/rubber bands when the outside temp drops below freezing. If water flows from behind the wall,
the faucet is broken. Turn off water, discontinue use, and notify Owner/Agent immediately. Tenant(s) will be responsible for any
subsequent cost.

3) Washing machine faucets: There are usually two short rubber pieces of hose from your faucet to your washing machine. Disconnect
these from your machine and run them into the drain pipe in the wall. This will allow you to leave both faucets trickling.

4) Locate your water shut-off valve: It is a good idea to know the location of the water shut-off valve well in advance of severe weather.
If you cannot locate the valve, contact your utility company.

For all Units, When Temperature is Below 26°:

1) Keep all water inside the building running: It is important to keep water moving in all of the water pipes to prevent freezing. It
requires more than just a drop. Keep the stream approximately the width of a pencil lead (both hot and cold) from every faucet when
outside temperatures are 26°, and below. If you are worried about wasting hot water, turn off the electric breaker to your hot water
heater. Put a string through the flapper of your toilet to keep water flowing there.

2) Leave the heat on: Heat should be kept at a minimum of 62°. Open cupboards doors under sinks and leave them open as long as
temperature is below freezing to allow some heat near the pipes.

3) Notify Owner/Agent during extended winter absences: If you are going to be gone for longer than a couple of days when freezing
temperatures are possible, please notify Owner/Agent so appropriate measures can be taken.

If Your Pipes Freeze:

1) Locate water shut-off valve for unit and discontinue use (when applicable).
2) Turn off breakers to hot water.

3) Open all water lines, including outside faucets.

4) Notify Owner/Agent immediately.
Get heat on them to speed up the thawing process. This can be accomplished using:

1) A heat lamp.

2) A space heater.

3) A blow dryer.

Do not leave any of the above unattended for any period of time and NO OPEN FLAMES ON ANY PIPES AT ANYTIME! Should damage
occur due to the Tenant(s) failing to follow these instructions, the cost for repair shall be placed upon the Tenant(s), unless the damage is

the result of an act of God.

MOLD PREVENTION AGREEMENT

Tenant(s): [TENANT NAME 1]

Tenant(s): [TENANT NAME 2] et al (and all others)
Address: [STREET ADDRESS] Unit:

City: [CITY] , OREGON Zip: [ZIP CODE]
AGREEMENT

Mold growth can be dangerous to people and destructive to property. Owner/Agent provides housing
as free from mold as reasonably possible. Behaviors of Tenant(s) greatly affect the likelihood of
mold growth.

Tenant(s) agree(s) to keep the Rental Unit in a manner that minimizes the likelihood of mold
growth. Suggested methods to do that are listed on the reverse of this Notice. Tenant(s) also agree(s)
to notify Owner/Agent promptly of any mold problems.

Tenant(s) acknowledge receiving a copy of this notice

Tenant Date Tenant Date

Tenant Date Tenant Date

Tenant Date Tenant Date

Owner/Agent Date Owner/Agent Date

WHAT IS MOLD?

Mold is a fungus, a sponge-like organism, in the same family as yeast and mushrooms. Mold is
everywhere. Molds produce tiny spores that float continuously through the air, indoor and out.
When mold spores land on a damp area indoors, they can begin to grow, particularly if the moisture
problem is not corrected quickly. Molds can grow on wood, ceiling tiles, drywall, paper, carpet and
foods. There is no practical way to eliminate all mold and mold spores indoors. The most effective
way to control indoor mold growth is to control moisture. Unwanted moisture can be from a variety
of issues: leaks in the roof or walls, water seeping into the basement, taking a shower, or cooking.
If mold grows in a home, it must both be cleaned and the moisture problem repaired. Mold growth
is unlikely if the humidity is below 40%.

HOW YOU CAN MINIMIZE LIKELIHOOD OF MOLD GROWTH

Use the bathroom fan, leave it running for 45 minutes after bathing or showering.

If your bathroom doesn't have a fan, open the window and leave it open for 45 minutes
after bathing or showering. Leave the door open when not in use.

* Use the kitchen fan whenever cooking. If there isn't one, open a window slightly.

* Use the fan in the laundry area,

* If moisture condenses on windows or walls, turn up the thermostat on your heat source.
* Open doors between rooms and to closets to increase air circulation.

* Cover fish tanks.

* Don't keep too many house plants, and don't over-water the ones you keep.

* Keep the temperature above 65 degrees.

* Open several windows for at least an hour twice a week to change the air in your home.
* Dry any water that spills on carpets or rugs.

* If you have an air conditioner, be sure it isn't leaking.

* Use a dehumidifier if necessary.

IF YOU SEE MOLD

Clean mold off hard surfaces as soon as possible. First use a detergent like Pine Sol or Lysol and hot
water. Then disinfect with a mild bleach solution (one cup of bleach to one gallon of water). (Do
not get bleach solution on carpets or floors, it can cause damage.) Finally, dry completely. Recent
studies suggest bleach isn't enough for porous surfaces like sheet rock walls. Wash with TSP (tri-
sodium phosphate) first (available at hardware and paint stores).

When you clean up mold, consider using an N-95 respirator (available in many hardware stores)
to limit your exposure to mold and mold spores.

WHAT YOU SHOULD REPORT TO THE OWNER/AGENT

* Leaks anywhere; in the roof, gutters, walls, doors, or windows for instance.
* Water in the basement or crawlspace under your home.

* Leaking pipes or dripping faucets.

* Sweating pipes or toilets.

* Running toilets.

* Any reappearance of mold after you've cleaned and removed it.

* Any recurring dampness or moldy smell.

* Non-working fans.

SEPTIC AGREEMENT M17

Tenant(s): [TENANT NAME 1]

Tenant(s): [TENANT NAME 2] et al (and all others)
Address: [STREET ADDRESS] Unit:
City: [CITY] , OREGON Zip: [ZIP CODE]

The property you are leasing utilizes a septic system to process waste and waste water from the Dwelling Unit. This information is
provided to help residents avoid damaging the waste system.

Only the three P's should go down the waste pipes: pee, poop, paper (toilet paper, of course).

* No oil

* No grease

No bleach (Oxi-Clean is an acceptable fabric whitening product that will not damage the system).
* No chemicals of any kind

* No prescription medications

* No food waste

* No feminine hygiene products
* No "flushable" wipes

* No baby wipes

* No paper towels

Water usage is key to septic management

Sending too much waste water into the septic system at one time dilutes the beneficial bacteria that help break down the waste, so space
out bathing and laundry activities to

avoid diluting the bacteria in the system.

Flushing additives into the septic
system to help initiate bacterial
breakdown is not necessary and
may contribute to the failure of the
system. Do not dump sour milk, raw
meat, or any other substance down
the drain in an effort to increase
bacteria. The only product that can
have a beneficial effect is Rid-X,
but it's really not necessary if the
rules listed above are followed.

[Septic system diagram referenced but not detailed]

If waste is backing up in the toilet
or any other drain, Tenant(s) agree
to stop using the system and notify
Owner/Agent immediately.

Damage caused by failure to abide by these instructions will result in charges for repair being passed to Tenant(s) for payment.

WELL AGREEMENT M18

Tenant(s): [TENANT NAME 1]

Tenant(s): [TENANT NAME 2] et al (and all others)
Address: [STREET ADDRESS] Unit:

City: [CITY] OREGON Zip: [ZIP CODE]

The leased property uses a residential well to provide water for drinking, washing and waste removal.

For a property to be sold in Oregon, the well must be capable of producing a minimum of five gallons per minute under normal conditions.
This amount can vary depending on season, so if Tenant(s) experiences some slowing of water flow, usage should be adjusted and care
taken to not run the well dry by performing only one water task at a time. If the water level drops below the level of the pump, the pump

will continue to run, will suck air instead of water and may burn out requiring replacement.

Tenant(s) is/are responsible for monitoring water usage to ensure
this doesn't happen. Should water flow become measurably
reduced at any time, Tenant(s) must stop water usage and notify
Owner/Agent immediately.

In freezing conditions, Tenant(s) agrees to protect pipes from
freezing by leaving light on in well house, or using space heater
in well house as needed.

Well water has been tested for
contaminants as follows:

Nitrates
Fecal Coliform
Arsenic
Other: [OTHER CONTAMINANTS TESTED]

Date of last testing: [WELL TEST DATE]

If Tenant(s) notice odd odor or color to water, Tenant(s) agree to
stop using system and notify Owner/Agent immediately.
